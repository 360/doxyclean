Usage: doxyclean.py [-h] [-i indir] [-o outdir]

Options:	-h			Converts the cleaned XML to XHTML styled similarly to Apple's documentation
			-i indir	Specifies the directory with XML files generated by Doxygen
			-o outdir	Specifies the directory to place the cleaned XML files

Converts the XML files generated by Doxygen to 
be more easily-read and more catered to Objective-C.

DoxyClean is a very early work in progress. Currently, you lose a lot of things generated by Doxygen, such as cross-class linking and inheritance diagrams. I hope to add these back in soon.

Currently, DoxyClean cleans every file's documentation. In the future, I hope to add back the option to only clean those files which are actually documented.

If you make any modifications to DoxyClean which might be of use, please send them to me at matt@mattballdesign.com
